Original work

        This question type is written by Penny Leach at Liip <penny@liip.ch> and is an incomplete work in progress.

        Unfortunately, it involved patching form-related code two times:

        http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-18400
        http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-18862

        The patches for all of these are in the patches/ directory.

        Basic spec is at http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Matrix_Question_Type_Specification and associated forum thread here:

CHANGE LOG:

1   Changed the name "longtext" to description in the "column" and "row" tables. Name clashes with MySQL longtext reserved name.
2   Upgraded DB to Moodle 2.0
3   Added support for fill in correct responses
5   Bug correction: submit question in preview mode does not take the last entered values
6   Added style.css to page
7   Changed header description html to work in other navigators than ie -
8   Added feedback for rows
9   Updgraded backup/restore system to Moodle 2.0
10  Added French translations
11  Looks like the patches are not needed anymore for Moodle 2.0.2, removing them
12  Todo: 'save format in the database'. Still not seeing the point to change the text format. Cancelling this until someone comes with a good reason to support it.
13  Defaulted values to type KPrime: four rows, two cols (true, false), eval method kprime.
14  Added k' grading type
15  Bug: general feedback was displayed twice
16  Bug: display correct answer when reviewing
